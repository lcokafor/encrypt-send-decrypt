# encrypt-send-decrypt

A small personal project involving asymmetric encryption and UDP socket communication. This project is still in progress.

To-do list:
- commandline arguments/user input for port number, IP address, message to be encrypted/decrypted
- work on sending/receiving so that sent/received data can be of arbitrary size
- extra layer of security on private key file? (if implemented, include that in commandline arguments/user input questions)
